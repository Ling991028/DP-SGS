# Code Implementation of DP-SGS for EIT Reconstruction Inverse Problem

This repository contains a concise Python implementation for solving the Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) inverse problem, 
focusing on the **Diffusion prior split Gibbs sampler (DP-SGS)** algorithm. For comparative analysis, 
implementations of the **Generative Plug-and-Play with BM3D Denoiser (GPnP-BM3D)** and **Randomize-then-Optimize Metropolis-Hastings (RTO-MH)** algorithms are also provided. 
This code serves as a numerical case study for researchers interested in Bayesian inference and advanced sampling methods for computational inverse problems.
